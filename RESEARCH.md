## 🚨 The AI Data Crisis

### The Core Problem

Modern AI systems require massive amounts of training data, but the methods used to acquire this data are ethically questionable and legally risky.

### TODO: Add Research

**What to include:**
- How AI companies currently collect training data (web scraping, data brokers, etc.)
- Specific examples of controversial data collection practices
- Quotes from AI researchers or ethicists about the problem
- Statistics on how much data is needed to train modern AI models

**Example structure:**
```
According to [SOURCE], training GPT-3 required [X] terabytes of data,
most of which was scraped from the internet without explicit consent.

[COMPANY] faced backlash when it was revealed they scraped [X] million
images from [SOURCE] without photographer permission.
```
